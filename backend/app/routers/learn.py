            ("Pay on time, every time", "Payment history matters most. One payment more than 30 days late can stay on your report for years. Autopay for at least the minimum due prevents accidents."),

            ("SIPs", "A Systematic Investment Plan puts a fixed amount into a mutual fund every month. It removes the temptation to time the market, and buys more units when prices are low."),
